            Me and my friends are always doing or on the way to doing something interesting. Currently, we are building a trading bot.<br/><br/>
            In my free time, I enjoy taking a walk, playing the piano, and watching stand-up comedy. <br/><br/>
            I also love to watch Rick and Morty episodes.<br/><br/>
