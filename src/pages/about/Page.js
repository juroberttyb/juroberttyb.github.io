            Me and my friends are always doing or on the way to doing something interesting.<br/>
            Currently, we are building a trading bot on Ethereum.<br/><br/>
            In my free time, I enjoy taking a walk, playing piano jazz, and watching stand-up comedy.<br/>
            I also make ecosystems from time to time.
