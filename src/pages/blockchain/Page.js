            I found blockchain technologies to be very interesting in 2022,
            and I believe in one way or another,
            it would make our world a better place in the long run. <br/><br/>

            Despite many bad news and rug pulls in 2022,
            I see many passionate developers and ethereum node operator communities still working on a better future.
            Influenced by them and their vision, not just there trying to make quick money,
            the goal that anyone anyplace anytime can access their funds and a world virtual machine,
            drives me to get involved in the community and try to do my part to help. <br/><br/>

            I am currently working on a trading bot, to get familiar with smart contracts and ethereum virtual machine,
            and I aim myself to be a blockchain developer in the future.
